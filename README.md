# React Multiform

## Overview 
You saw what I did in class, now its your turn to pick up from there. 

## Instructions
0. You can work on this using whatever tools you prefer. I used [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) and [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction#react) and you can use whatever you want.
1. Make sure to regularly push the code to github
2. Once you're done, copy all the link and submit it in the assignment on Canvas.

Good luck!
